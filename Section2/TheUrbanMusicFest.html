 	<p>The Urban Music Fest was created in response to the African American Quality of Life Initiative to create an experience in Austin, TX that lovers of R&B, Jazz, neo-soul, and gospel could enjoy. Founded by Donnie Little and Homer Hill, Urban Life Group was formed to organize the first festival to be held at the Town Lake Auditorium. Nowadays versions of events like “Woodstok”, EDM music,artwork and other crafts are created by local artists and shared with the community while they camp out.
